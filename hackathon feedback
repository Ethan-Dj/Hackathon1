Basketball coach assistant APP.
What I really love about this app is that its practical.
Its not a game thats been done 1000 of times before or a todo list,
Its an actual useful app that can be used for something that you care about.
Your code is relatively orginised with comments explaining your code .
Comments like this are necessary , especially when working in a team.
I would add an undo button incase of a misclick.
Maybe a bit of styling too although your functionality outdoes styling by a long shot so its not important.

You've done a wonderful job all around.
FANTASTIC!
